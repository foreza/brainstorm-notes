# Premise

In game development, I learned that your game should define 3-4 core pillars.
Each pillar represents a specific aspect that all features and design decisions should align with.
It is used to clearly decide what should/can be done.
Pillars can change. But it's used as a tool to provide a clear line in the sand.

I'll use this to help sort out what I want in life.


# Changelog

## 0.0.1

- Created this repo and this document.
- Defined initial pillars (4) and some initial content


# TODO

- Trim down the various many goals and add specific milestones for each one. 
- Prioritize the top pillars to help simply any decision making
- Pick and declare 3 active goals in progress at any time, with one primary goal and 2 secondary ones.
- Put all other "goals" in a list to be reviewed regularily.. collect any new ones as well in a bin
- Schedule a time each month to religiously review all goals
- List all biases that could influence how you rank a goal. 
- Define a goal metrics. Current working def: A goal's milestone must be attained within a month of starting the goal, or it's a bad goal. 
- Create a bragsheet with a date as to when each milestone has been reached and which category it is


# Pillars


## Pillar 1: Act as a bridge between east and west.

My goals for this pillar are derived from my constant need to reconnect with my Taiwanese/Chinese roots.
This pillar ensures that I can communicate effectively across these 2 cultural silos while also deepening my understanding of what I already know.
The long term goal is to set myself up for later career and personal success as effective communication coupled with technical understanding is a good combination to have.

Chinese:
- Be able to order off of a menu in simplified or traditional chinese
- Be able to read short stories and blog posts in chinese

- etc


## Pillar 2: Serve as a Technical Problem Solver.

My goals for this pillar aim to establish technical fluency to solve problems. 
This pillar ensures that I have a good career and can always put food on the table.

**- Being able to accurately translate a complex technical concept or problem into simple terms to communicate to a non-tech exec, AND make them care about it enough to take action or course correct**
**- Have the skills and toolset to accurately assess a wide array of business problems from a technical angle**

Other goals that fit into this pillar:
- Remain up to date with iOS/Android development.
- Be able to use the CLI
- Understand how to work with lower level core languages (C,C++,)
- Be familiar with technical tooling (compilers, IDEs, proxys)
- Understand the technical landscape (browsers, routers, the internet, mobile phones, servers)
- Be familiar with front end principles and how these translate into business needs and what pains there are here
- Be familiar with back end principles and what sort of problems are seen
- Be comfortable with large data sets
- Understanding algorithms and how they form the backbone
- Be familiar with various types of encryption and security protocols 
- Be familiar with the software development process, the tooling involved, and the lifecycle
- Automating the mundane to reduce human error
- Be comfortable talking to engineers of all levels (intern, junior, senior, lead, staff, CTO)
- Be comfortable talking to other operations of the business of all levels and types (sales associate, product manager, project manager, accounting, HR, etc) 
- Being good at researching what I don't know


## Pillar 3: Maintain a healthy mind and body.

My goals for this pillar aim to ensure that I have a good solid base to grow from.
By remaining fit, I ensure that my body is given the best possible chance of survival.
By keeping a healthy mind, I ensure that I'm able to be as receptive as possible!

### Fitness Goals 
- Running regularily for 20-30 min a day. Cardio!
- Being able to bench press 2 plates.
- Squat 3 plates.
- Dumb bell press 50s again.
- 10 pullups.
- Pursue a martial art
- etc


### Mind Goals
- Regular mediation sessions
- Take regualar time off from work to do things like this (planning for the future)
- Training myself to listen more, speak only when necessary and the "right" amount
- etc
- Challenge regular assumptions that I make that are likely incorrect
- Read a book a month
- Clean up my desk of clutter before I do any work
- Donate or recycle things I clearly do not need, avoid hoarding
- Buy things that I actually will need, and buy at the correct level of quality (don't cheap out)


## Pillar 4: Access some "exclusive" status.

My goals for this pillar aim to ensure that I'm "excited" about belonging.
Part of this ensures I commit entirely to a specific venture or goal as it's typically much harder to attain exclusivity without fully investing in something.
This aims to explore the various perks and benefits we get by pledging loyalty rather than being on the divide.
This also ensures I fully explore the problem domain so that I am "in the know".
If I need to pay some $$ to get that status, I then need to weigh pros/cons as to whether it also syngergizes with another of my pillars. 

### Access
- Being able to access a hotel private lounge or bar or area through earning premium status with them
- Get through an airport faster than everyone else.
- Board first for a flight without having to pay for a 1st class ticket.
- Enter an airport lounge on my own merit.
- Be invited to a conference of some sort to speak about something.

### Certifications
- Masters degree in something. 
- Cybersecurity certification?
