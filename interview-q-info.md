# Interview Questions


It's good to have a list of stuff handy any time I get on a call with a recruiter.

## My Script to often asked questions to me

> Why are you lookinng for a change / why are you considering leaving?

My current role isn't allowing me to grow in the direction I want. 

I've also been here for some time, and I'd like to see what other options there are on the table with my current level of experience. 


> What is your expected salary?

Counter: Is there a specific budget that you have allocated for the role?

(Otherwise, say current sal) + I'd need a decent enough bump to consider making the move.
